...(other cases)

All scenarios were executed using the defined automation framework. Upon completion, an Allure Report has been generated, which provides a detailed overview of the test execution results, including passed and failed cases, execution timeline, and environment details.

This ensures that the application has been validated against the predefined test cases, and any findings are documented in the report.

Allure report is attached to the email.

Please let me know if you would like me to highlight specific results or provide additional insights from the execution.

Best regards,
